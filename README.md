#### Notes
It is an example of data presentation in a pagination table, and CRUD functionality.

#### Users
It is a simple example of how to manage registered users.

#### Menu management 
It is a system that allows you to create a new menu and edit existing menus. To place a new menu named "new" in any view use this code:
```php
        <?php
            use the App\MenuBuilder\FreelyPositionedMenus;
            if(isset($appMenus['new'])){
                FreelyPositionedMenus::render( $appMenus['new'] , '', 'your-css-class-of-ul-element');
            }
        ?>  
```
#### Manage menu items
Allows you to add, edit and delete menu items.
To add a new menu item to the menu you must:
* specify to which menu you are adding the item,
* specify the roles of users for whom the item will be visible
* name the item
* type ( to choice: link, title and dropdown)
* Href, the address to which the item is to refer,
* Parent (To nest the item inside dropdown)
* CORUI icons

#### Role management
Allows you to create, edit, delete and reorder user roles.
When a user has more than one role, the highest hierarchical role is used to create a menu for him.

#### Manage media
It allows to:
* Create virtual media folders.
* Send media to applications.
* Move media between folders,
* Cut images,

#### BREAD system
BREAD stands for: browse, read, edit, add, delete.
Our BREAD system allows you to easily and quickly generate for any table, from the database, a simple BREAD.
To create a new BREAD just enter a table name from the database.  Then enter a name for the form. Enter the number of rows in the browse table. Choose if you want the browse table to contain buttons: "show", "edit", "add", "delete".
Assign roles for users who will be able to use the ready BREAD.
Then complete each column of the table separately:
* the column name visible to the user,
* the input type for the column,
The last step is to select the appropriate checkboxes:
* browse (allows to display the column in the data table),
* read (allows you to display the column in the show view,)
* edit (enables column editing)
* add (allows you to complete the column data when adding a record. Required if the column is not nullable).
It is also possible to handle relationships with another table.
If the column is a foreign key, it should be specified: in the field "Optional relation table name" - table name to which the foreign key refers, in the "Optional column name in relation table - to print" field - the name of the column that is in the relation table to be displayed. Finally, select one of the two "field types" that relate to the relation: 'relation select' or 'relation radio'.
